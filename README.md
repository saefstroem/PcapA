# `PcapA` - A PCAP parser library written in Rust

## Description

As part of my journey to learn more about the internals of networking, I decided to write a PCAP parser library in Rust. This library is a work in progress and is not yet feature complete. The goal of this library is to provide a simple and easy to use API for parsing PCAP files. The idea is that this library will be part of my implementation of a network packet analyzer in Rust.
